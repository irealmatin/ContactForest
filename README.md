# ðŸ“ž ContactForest: Phone Contact Management System 

Welcome to **ContactForest**, a simple  phone contact management system built using a custom tree data structure. This project allows you to efficiently store, search, update, and delete contacts while ensuring fast and optimized operations.

---

##  Features

- **Tree-Based Storage**: Each digit of a phone number is stored as a node in the tree, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

- **Fast Operations**: Insertion, search, update, and deletion operations are performed in **O(d)** time, where **d** is the number of digits in the phone number.


---

##  How It Works

1. **Tree Structure**:
   - Each node in the tree represents a digit (0-9).
   - The path from the root to a leaf node represents a complete phone number.
   - Leaf nodes store contact information (name, email, job info, etc.).

2. **Operations**:
   - **Add Contact**: Insert a new contact into the tree.
   - **Search Contact**: Find a contact by their phone number.
   - **Update Contact**: Modify the details of an existing contact.
   - **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact from the tree.
